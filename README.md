# Dexter ðŸ¤–

Dexter is an autonomous research agent that thinks, plans, and learns as it works. It performs analysis using task planning, self-reflection, and real-time web search. Think Claude Code, but built for intelligent research and information gathering.

## Overview

Dexter takes complex questions and turns them into clear, step-by-step research plans. It runs those tasks using web search, checks its own work, and refines the results until it has a confident, data-backed answer.  

It's not just another chatbot.  It's an agent that plans ahead, verifies its progress, and keeps iterating until the job is done.

**Key Capabilities:**

- **Intelligent Task Planning**: Automatically decomposes complex queries into structured research steps
- **Autonomous Execution**: Selects and executes the right tools to gather information
- **Self-Validation**: Checks its own work and iterates until tasks are complete
- **Real-Time Web Search**: Search the internet for up-to-date information using Tavily API
- **Safety Features**: Built-in loop detection and step limits to prevent runaway execution

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or higher
- [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) package manager
- OpenAI API key (get one at [platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com))
- Tavily API key (get one at [tavily.com](https://tavily.com))

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/virattt/dexter.git
cd dexter
```

2. Install dependencies with uv:

```bash
uv sync
```

3. Set up your environment variables:

```bash
# Copy the example environment file
cp env.example .env

# Edit .env and add your API keys
# OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
# TAVILY_API_KEY=your-tavily-api-key

# Optional: Limit Tavily searches per session (useful for free tier)
# TAVILY_MAX_SEARCHES_PER_SESSION=5

# Optional: Enable LangSmith for observability (see LANGSMITH_GUIDE.md)
# LANGSMITH_API_KEY=your-langsmith-api-key
# LANGSMITH_PROJECT=dexter-project
# LANGSMITH_TRACING=true
```

### Usage

Run Dexter in interactive mode:

**Default version (LangChain chains):**

```bash
uv run dexter-agent
```

**LangGraph version (better scalability and control flow):**

```bash
uv run dexter-agent --use-graph
```

**With custom parameters:**

```bash
uv run dexter-agent --use-graph --max-steps 30 --max-steps-per-task 5
```

**Available flags:**

- `--use-graph`: Use LangGraph-based implementation
- `--max-steps`: Maximum number of total steps (default: 20)
- `--max-steps-per-task`: Maximum iterations per task (default: 3)

## Architecture

Dexter uses a multi-agent architecture with specialized components:

- **Planning Agent**: Analyzes queries and creates structured task lists
- **Action Agent**: Selects appropriate tools and executes research steps
- **Validation Agent**: Verifies task completion and data sufficiency
- **Answer Agent**: Synthesizes findings into comprehensive responses

## Observability with LangSmith (Optional)

Dexter has built-in support for [LangSmith](https://smith.langchain.com/), LangChain's observability platform. LangSmith provides:

- **Complete tracing**: See every step of agent execution
- **Debugging**: Identify exactly where things go wrong  
- **Performance monitoring**: Measure latency and token usage
- **Cost tracking**: Monitor API costs per query

To enable LangSmith:

1. Get an API key at [smith.langchain.com](https://smith.langchain.com/)
2. Add to your `.env` file:
   ```bash
   LANGSMITH_API_KEY=your-api-key
   LANGSMITH_PROJECT=dexter-project
   LANGSMITH_TRACING=true
   ```
3. Run Dexter normally - traces will appear automatically in LangSmith

For detailed setup and usage, see [LANGSMITH_GUIDE.md](LANGSMITH_GUIDE.md)

## Managing API Quotas (Tavily Free Tier)

If you're using Tavily's free tier (1,000 searches/month), you can limit searches per session:

```bash
# In your .env file
TAVILY_MAX_SEARCHES_PER_SESSION=5
```

This will:
- Limit the agent to 5 Tavily searches per session
- Show remaining searches in the CLI
- Prevent exceeding your monthly quota
- Allow other tools (calculator, stock_info) to work normally

For more details, see [TAVILY_LIMIT_GUIDE.md](TAVILY_LIMIT_GUIDE.md)

## Configuration

Dexter supports configuration via command-line flags or programmatic initialization:
